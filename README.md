Aircnc is a airbnb-like app where developers can search for places to code. Developed by Rocketseat on a event called 'Omnistack Week' during october 2019

This repository is the server package for Aircnc, but with changes i've made to practice some concepts and libraries

You can see the original version of Aircnc [here](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/aircnc)
